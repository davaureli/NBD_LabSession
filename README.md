# NBD_LabSession_20/21
In this repository you will find all the scripts related to the NBD Course of 20/21

This course is composed by three main parts:

1) Reading a pcap file by python, extracting info and splitting it.

2) Create the Dataframe from a starting pcap, analyzing different statistics from flow-based to Geographical referentiation IP addresses

3) **Machine Learning** (ML) Problem from scratch --> Classification field:

    a) **Supervised Learning**: D. Rossi, S. Valenti - ”Fine-grained traffic classification with Netflow data” (2010)
    
    b)**Unsupervised Learning**: Y. Zeng, T.M. Chen - ” Classification of Traffic Flows into QoS Classes by Unsupervised Learning and KNN Clustering” (2009)
    
    
At the end will be assigned the final project, you will work in group based on the team used during the course with the other Professors.

**Project**: The project can be divided into 2 main parts:

1) Statistical analysis: you will receive a trace from https://mawi.wide.ad.jp/mawi/ , we ask you to replicate the analysis observed during the lecture and maybe add something new

2) ML problem: you will receive a pickle trace (600k packets) and you will choose to replicate or (a) or (b) from *Lecture 3* 

**Deadline**:By July
